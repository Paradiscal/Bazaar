Bazaar is a small content mod that aims to fill any gaps in vanilla.

It currently is a small mod, but the content is polished and playable. It has many useful pieces of content, a new tier from night mobs, a slime rain spawner, 2 new quest fish, etc.

I recommend using this in a modpack, as it is work in progress and minimal.

Check out the mod post for more info and a link to our very own discord server, with spoilers and more!
